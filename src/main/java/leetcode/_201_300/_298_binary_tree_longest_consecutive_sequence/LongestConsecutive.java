/**
 * Given a binary tree, find the length of the longest consecutive sequence path.
 *
 * <p>The path refers to any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along
 * the parent-child connections. The longest consecutive path need to be from parent to child
 * (cannot be the reverse).
 *
 * <p>Have you met this question in a real interview? Example Example 1:
 *
 * <p>Input: 1 \ 3 / \ 2 4 \ 5 Output:3 Explanation: Longest consecutive sequence path is 3-4-5, so
 * return 3. Example 2:
 *
 * <p>Input: 2 \ 3 / 2 / 1 Output:2 Explanation: Longest consecutive sequence path is 2-3,not 3-2-1,
 * so return 2.
