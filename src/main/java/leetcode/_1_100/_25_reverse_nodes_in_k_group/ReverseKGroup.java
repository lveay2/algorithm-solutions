/**
 * Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list.
 *
 * <p>k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the
 * number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.
 *
 * <p>Example:
 *
 * <p>Given this linked list: 1->2->3->4->5
 *
 * <p>For k = 2, you should return: 2->1->4->3->5
 *
 * <p>For k = 3, you should return: 3->2->1->4->5
 *
 * <p>Note:
 *
 * <p>Only constant extra memory is allowed. You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only
 * nodes itself may be changed.
