/**
 * Given n pieces of wood with length L[i] (integer array). Cut them into small pieces to guarantee
 * you could have equal or more than k pieces with the same length. What is the longest length you
 * can get from the n pieces of wood? Given L & k, return the maximum length of the small pieces.
 *
 * <p>样例 Example 1
 *
 * <p>Input: L = [232, 124, 456] k = 7 Output: 114 Explanation: We can cut it into 7 pieces if any
 * piece is 114cm long, however we can't cut it into 7 pieces if any piece is 115cm long.
 *
 * <p>Example 2
 *
 * <p>Input: L = [1, 2, 3] k = 7 Output: 0 Explanation: It is obvious we can't make it. 挑战 O(n log
 * Len), where Len is the longest length of the wood.
 *
 * <p>注意事项 You couldn't cut wood into float length.
 *
 * <p>If you couldn't get >= k pieces, return 0.
